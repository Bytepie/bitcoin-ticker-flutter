## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, you'll be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move! The original API for ticker in the tutorial is not available anymore as free. So I used [BlockChain Exchange API](https://www.blockchain.com/api/exchange_rates_api "BlockChain Exchange API").
